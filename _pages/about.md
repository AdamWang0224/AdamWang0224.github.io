I am currently an MPhil student at University of Cambridge, majoring in Data Intensive Science. Before that, I received my bachelor degree in 2024 from Department of Mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Wenxue Li. 

In the final year of my undergraduate studies, I was very fortunate to receive the Singapore International Pre-Graduate Award ([SIPGA](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/singapore-international-graduate-award-singa)) and subsequently worked as a research assistant at the Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, under the supervision of Principal Scientist [Jun Cheng](https://samjcheng.github.io/), and as a research intern at the School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, under the supervision of Prof. [Dianbo Liu](http://www.cogai4sci.com/). 

My research interests lie in the computer vision and machine learning, and I am happy to explore a wide range of related topics, including generative models, multi-modality learning and their applications in healthcare.
